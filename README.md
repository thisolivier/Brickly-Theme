# Brickly Wordpress
A React.js Wordpress theme. The theme can be installed as any normal theme can be, and will serve a SPA to your client. It is in the early stages of development.

## Plans and Ideas

For the animation framework, I think using the canvas is going to be the right call, so I need to finish the youtube tutorial [I was working though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxljFhP2krI&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW3We9VdCfx9fprhqXHwTPXL&index=4).

## To Install

Build the theme by installing Node 6+ on your machine, and running `$ npm install` in the theme directory, then `$ npm run build` to build the theme/app into `./react_app_built`, or `$ npm run watch` to use Webpack to watch for changes. Author info can be added by making a page and setting the ID in the wordpress `functions.php`, wherethe data is injected.
