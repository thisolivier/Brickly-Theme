Sage is a WordPress starter theme with a modern development workflow.

**Sage 9 is in active development and is only currently in alpha. The `master` branch tracks Sage 9 development. If you want a stable version, use the [latest Sage 8 release](https://github.com/roots/sage/releases/latest).**

## Features

* Sass for stylesheets
* ES6 for JavaScript
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for compiling assets, optimizing images, and concatenating and minifying files
* [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for synchronized browser testing
* [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/) for a front-end framework (can be removed or replaced)
* Template inheritance with the [theme wrapper](https://roots.io/sage/docs/theme-wrapper/)

See a working example at [roots-example-project.com](https://roots-example-project.com/).

## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

* [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) >= 5.5.x
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 4.5

## Theme installation

Install Sage using Composer from your WordPress themes directory (replace `your-theme-name` below with the name of your theme):

```shell
# @ example.com/site/web/app/themes/
$ composer create-project roots/sage your-theme-name dev-master
```

## Theme structure

## Theme setup

Edit `src/setup.php` to enable or disable theme features, setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, post formats, and sidebars.

## Theme development

Sage uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as a build tool and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install dependencies

From the command line on your host machine (not on your Vagrant development box), navigate to the theme directory then run `npm install`:

```shell
# @ example.com/site/web/app/themes/your-theme-name
$ npm install
```

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Build commands

* `npm start` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start BrowserSync session
* `npm run build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `npm run build:production` — Compile assets for production

#### Additional commands

* `npm run clean` — Remove your `dist/` folder
* `npm run lint` — Run eslint against your assets and build scripts
* `composer test` — Check your PHP for code smells with `phpmd` and PSR-2 compliance with `phpcs`

### Using BrowserSync

To use BrowserSync during `npm start` you need to update `devUrl` at the bottom of `assets/config.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

If your local development URL is `https://project-name.dev`, update the file to read:
```json
...
  "devUrl": "https://project-name.dev",
...
```

If you are not using [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/), update `publicPath` to reflect your folder structure:

```json
...
  "publicPath": "/wp-content/themes/sage/"
...
```

By default, BrowserSync will use webpack's [HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html), which won't trigger a page reload in your browser.

If you would like to force BrowserSync to reload the page whenever certain file types are edited, then add them to `watch` in `assets/config.json`.

```json
...
  "watch": [
    "assets/scripts/**/*.js",
    "templates/**/*.php",
    "src/**/*.php"
  ],
...
```
